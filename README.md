# stock-analysis
## Overview
Steve, a recent finance graduate, needed to further analyze green energy stocks for his parents, who are his first clients. First, they wanted to invest all their money in DQ, but then figured that they may need to diversify their portfolio. As a result, Steve sought our help in running Excel VBA code in order to analyze stock data in a short period of time. While we were able to write a successful VBA macro that can analyze data from a dozen stocks, our code may took too long to analyze thousands of stocks. Therefore, in this analysis, we will refactor our VBA code so Steve can use to not only analyze data for a dozen stocks, but rather for thousands of them in a short period of time.

## Results
Stocks that were analyzed seem to perform far better in 2017 (add screenshots, take screenshots of how long VBA takes to process code).

### Summary
The advantages of refactoring code make programs run faster and more efficiently. This can make code less concrete and more versatile to be applied to larger numbers of stocks (as in this analysis), and as a result, can be used in different scenarios as well. The disadvantages might include coding to be more detail-oriented, making it prone for creating mistakes that will allow code to not run. It would also require formatting our code more and adding more comments and descriptions so that code can be easier to understand for others. (add advantages/disadvantages for this module/challenge)
